4 assignments for Natural language processing course

# nlp-1:

creating a corpus from Knesset protocol files. The tasks include extracting text from the protocol files, segmenting the text into sentences, cleaning the sentences, and tokenizing the text. The output is a CSV file containing the processed data.

# nlp-2:

building language models using n-grams on the Knesset corpus. The task involves implementing Trigram language models for committee and plenary protocols, then using the models to fill in missing tokens in masked sentences and calculate the probability of the sentences.

# nlp-3:

classifying text chunks from the Knesset corpus as either committee or plenary. The tasks involve creating feature vectors from the text chunks, training classification models (KNN and SVM), evaluating the models, and then classifying new, unlabeled text chunks.

# nlp-4:

working with word embeddings. The tasks include training a Word2Vec model on the Knesset corpus, using the model to find similar words and sentences, and then using the sentence embeddings for classification. The document also introduces the use of a pre-trained language model, DictaBERT, to fill in missing words in sentences.
